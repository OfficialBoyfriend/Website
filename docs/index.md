## Better Kuka Robot Language documentation

This website is a **community** effort to provide better documentation for the Kuka Robot Language (KRL).
Its goal is to become a shared tool for robot developers (industrial, researcher, student, ...).

## Quick start

Go to the [language reference](./krl/reference/system.types/) section to get started.
Or hit the `s` or `f` key on your keyboard to search for a `KRL` entry.

## What to expect

* full language reference documentation in a modern html layout with powerful search capabilities and cross referencing
* additional resources (how to, tutorials, ...)
* discover undocumented functionalities (crosscomm plugin, message database, ...)
* easy to contribute

## Contributing

All types of contributions are more than welcome.

The language reference documentation is written in simple `YAML` files. 
A side each item (type, variable or function) you will find a small *pencil icon* that will redirect you to the corresponding definition lines in the yaml file.
This way, it should be easy for anybody to propose corrections and enrichments of the existing documentation.

Please, read the [guidelines](./contributing.md) if you are decided to collaborate.
