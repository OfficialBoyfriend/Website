## Hi, I'm Lionel ([@lionpeloux](https://github.com/lionpeloux))

I'm a freelance structural engineer, researcher and entrepreneur from Lyon, France.
I've come to robot programming recently for one of my clients, a small stonecutting workshop equipped with a `KR-500-2MT`. 
Because of my background in other areas, I see the power of community-based knowledge and I do believe that shared knowledge brings more value in almost any scenarios.

## Why this website ?

Lots of people are complaining (understandably) about the quality of the documentation provided by Kuka to its customers.
Indeed we are often left with a bunch of crappy pdf documents, sometimes outdated, sometimes incorrect, sometimes incomplete ...
For a billion dollar company I find this is quite unfair (personal opinion !).

So I wanted to build a modern documentation website to provide a better access to the language reference with powerful search and cross referencing capabilities.

There is already a great source of support through the [Kuka Robot Forum](https://www.robot-forum.com/robotforum/kuka-robot-forum/). 
However, forums are not so great to provide structured content, which this site is all about. Though, they should complete well.
