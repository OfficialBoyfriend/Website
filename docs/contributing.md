## Submission context

### Got a question or problem ?
For quick questions there's no need to open an issue as you can reach us on [gitter.im](https://gitter.im/OpenKuka/community).

### Found a bug ?

If you found a bug in the source code, you can help us by submitting an issue to the issue tracker in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenKuka/Website/issues). Even better, you can submit a pull request with a fix. However, before doing so, please read the submission guidelines.

### Missing a feature ?
You can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub repository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that it is of use for everyone. Please consider what kind of change it is:

* For a major feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be discussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work, and help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.

* Small features and bugs can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request. However, there is no guarantee that your feature will make it into the master, as it's always a matter of opinion whether if benefits the overall functionality of the theme.
